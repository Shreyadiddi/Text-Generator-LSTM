# Text-Generator-LSTM
# Text Generation using LSTM

This is a mini project I built using Keras and LSTM to generate text based on a custom dataset.

Features:
- LSTM model for sequence prediction
- Trained on my own text data
- Generates new sentences based on seed text

Tools:
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab

Sample Output:
> "She was like a creeping vine began to ensnarl the townâ€™s spirit."

How to Run:
1. Open the notebook in Colab
2. Upload your own `.txt` file
3. Run all cells and tweak the generation code
